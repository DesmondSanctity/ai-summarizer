# ai-summarizer
An AI tool that summarizes text from documents using Langchain's Open AI implementation and Google Vertex AI.

In the application which has a client and server side, It allows users to upload documents or paste text in a textbox, and mention the number of paragraphs they want the summary to have for AI to summarize them. The summary for documents uses Langchain's Open AI implementation while the texts use Google Vertex AI.

It is an experiment on how LLM works and how different models can be fused to achieve a seemingly good result!
